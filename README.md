## A Sample Hero Carousel (Image/Video)

I worked on a project earlier in the year, where the client wanted a hero carousel that would support both images and videos (YouTube). The videos would start playing (looped and muted) when the current slide is active, and pause when the active slide loses focus (slide chage). They also wanted a play/pause button available when the video slide was active.

Needless to say, this took a bit work. Here is a sample of the code I used to get this workingas the client requested.

Note: This is example is very unlikely to be functional.
